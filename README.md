# Finetuning-
Creating a README file is essential for documenting your code, explaining its purpose, how to set it up, and how to use it. Hereâ€™s a template you can use for your project:

---

# Project Title

Describe your project in a brief sentence or two.

## Table of Contents

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Setup Instructions](#setup-instructions)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Dependencies](#dependencies)
- [License](#license)

## Overview

Provide an overview of your project. What does it do? What problem does it solve? Mention any key features or functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed (version X.X recommended).
   - Set up your Python environment using virtualenv or conda.

2. **Installation:**
   - Clone this repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
     cd your_project
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install required Python packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Configuration:**
   - Set up Kaggle credentials:
     - Set `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY` environment variables.

5. **Data Preparation:**
   - Download the dataset:
     ```
     wget -O databricks-dolly-15k.jsonl https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k/resolve/main/databricks-dolly-15k.jsonl
     ```

6. **Model Initialization:**
   - Initialize the GemmaCausalLM model:
     ```python
     import keras_nlp
     gemma_lm = keras_nlp.models.GemmaCausalLM.from_preset("gemma_2b_en")
     ```

## Usage

Describe how to use your code. Provide examples of commands or scripts to run for different functionalities. Include any important details or caveats.

### Example Usage

1. **Generating Responses:**
   - To generate a response for a specific prompt:
     ```python
     prompt = "How will I travel to Germany?"
     response = gemma_lm.generate(prompt, max_length=256)
     print(response)
     ```

## Dependencies

List the main dependencies and versions required to run your code. Include any specific libraries or tools that are essential.

- Python (>= X.X)
- keras-nlp
- keras (>= 3)
- Other dependencies...

## License

Specify the license under which your project is distributed (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.).

Adjust the sections and content based on your specific project details and requirements. Ensure the README provides clear instructions for setting up the environment, running the code, and understanding its functionality. This document serves as a guide for users and collaborators to understand and effectively use your codebase.
